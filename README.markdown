# Deprecation notice

Starting from version 12.1, [GitLab has a Let's Encrypt integration](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/lets_encrypt_integration.md), which makes this tool unnecessary.

See [README-DEPRECATED for the last published README](/README-DEPRECATED.markdown).
